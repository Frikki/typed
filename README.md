> Well-typed functional utilities

This is a collection of functional utilities akin to that of Ramda. Why does
it exist if Ramda already does? Well, it's 80% for learning purposes, 10%
for dogfooding my own project [Northbrook](https://github.com/northbrookjs/northbrook),
and remaining parts equal to awesome TypeScript typings and distribution of ES2015
modules.

## Let me have it!
```sh
npm install --save @typed/core

# or individual functions
npm install --save @typed/map @typed/filter
```
