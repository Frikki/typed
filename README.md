- [`@typed/either`](./packages/either) -- Well-typed and functional `Either`
- [`@typed/functions`](./packages/functions) -- Collection of functions for working with functions
- [`@typed/future`](./packages/future) -- Well-typed and functional `Future`
- [`@typed/lenses`](./packages/lenses) -- Well-typed functional lenses
- [`@typed/list`](./packages/list) -- Immutable `List` for TypeScript
- [`@typed/logic`](./packages/logic) -- Well-typed functions for performing logic

- [`@typed/objects`](./packages/objects) -- Collection of object-related functions

There is also [`@typed/prelude`](./packages/prelude) which is a package that simply 
re-exports all of the functions from the other packages.
